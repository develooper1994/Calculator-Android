Basic user interface design with very simple coding exercise for android

- There are 3 main methods run until an activity become visible: **onCreate**, **onStart**, **onResume**.
- Android deletes and creates a new MainActivity(user interface) class on every rotation. 
So that variables non-static variables are deleted and screen looks like fresh opened if you create inside **onCreate** method.
- Android studio got some AI features and that is awesome :). Even i did something without nothing.
